## Course Registration System
This is an end-to-end .NET project that implements MVC architectural pattern. It utilizes the Entity Framework for its model to integrate seamlessly with MySQL for querying and producing views on the front-end. The front-end is constructed using Blazor pages with some HTML/CSS/Javascript.

The project allows users to register themselves as on of the following roles:
- Admins
- Teachers
- Students
and allows them to access different features based on the role they use.

### Setting Up The Project:
This is a Docker and Kubernetes intensive project. For this reason, it is highly recommended to use Docker Desktop as it integrates smoothly with Kubernetes. For API testing, Postman API has been preferred. The use of SQLServer is optional as it is used to verify existing data objects, but strictly speaking is not necessary. You do not need a server instance as the server used inside our cluster is deployed using Kubernetes. The links to download all of these are listed below:
- [Download Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- [Download Postman API](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)
- [Download SQL Server Management Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver16) (optional)
